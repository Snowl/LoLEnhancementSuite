LoLEnhancementSuite
==================

A set of patches for the League of Legends client to enhance and fix bugs.

These mods are for the version `0.0.1.87`. This number wont be changed until ALL mods are updated. While the patcher WILL attempt to patch versions above it, bad things may happen.

The offical LESs patcher will patch all mods into your League of Legends client.
